- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @KingMatthew101 and I am a high school student learning programming and video game development.
     I'm currently working on small 2D games in Java and C#

     I'm also a musician and have some experience in 3D graphical design and am interested in working with others in these fields to add to the games I develop.
