- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @KingMatthew101 and I am a high school student learning programming and video game development.
     I'm currently working on developing a multiplayer 3rd person shooter through Unity using C#

     I'm also a musician and am decent in 3D graphical design, however I would be interested in working with others in these fields to add to the games I develop.

**This is a work in progress**
